## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- b666191: Restructure Docker build and release pipeline

  - **Multi-stage Docker build** excludes `packages/` from the final image. The builder stage resolves `workspace:*` refs to npm versions (via `scripts/resolve-workspace-refs.ts`), installs from npm, then the final stage copies only app code + node_modules.
  - **Release pipeline** is now a single sequential job: npm publish gates Zephyr deploy and Docker build. If npm publish fails, nothing else runs.
  - **Start command** uses `bos start` (binary from npm) instead of `bun packages/everything-dev/cli.js`. Account and domain are read from `bos.config.json`.
  - **`everything-dev` and `every-plugin`** moved to `dependencies` in root `package.json` (runtime deps in Docker).
  - **`docker.yml`** is now `workflow_dispatch` only — the release workflow builds Docker inline.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d4df05d: ## Infrastructure: CI optimization, Docker hardening, staging environments, config-driven architecture

  ### CI/CD improvements

  - **Consolidated lint + typecheck** into a single job (was 2 sequential), removing ~1-2 minutes per CI run
  - **Replaced `bun lint` + `bun format:check`** with single `biome ci .` command
  - **Pinned Bun version** to `"1.4"` in all workflows (was `latest`)
  - **Added native caching** via `setup-bun@v2` cache option (removed redundant `actions/cache`)
  - **Upgraded `actions/checkout`** from v6 to v4
  - **Parallelized typecheck** across packages using background processes (`& wait`)
  - **Staging deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/staging.yml`) — builds `:staging` image on merge to main
  - **Preview deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`) — builds `:pr-N` image per PR, comments preview URL
  - **CI workflows read domain from `bos.config.json`** via `jq` instead of hardcoding

  ### Docker hardening

  - **Non-root user**: Container now runs as `appuser` (UID 1001) instead of root
  - **Layer caching**: Dependencies installed before source code copy for better cache hits
  - **Bun 1.4**: Updated base image from `oven/bun:1.3.9-alpine` to `oven/bun:1.4-alpine`
  - **Added `curl` and `/health` healthcheck** with 30s interval
  - **Removed `Dockerfile.dev`**: Development flow uses `bos dev`, not a dev Docker image
  - **Added `railway.json`** for Railway deployment configuration with health checks

  ### Staging environment support

  - **Added `staging` field** to `BosConfigSchema` for staging domain configuration
  - **Added `--env` flag** to CLI start command supporting `production` and `staging` environments
  - **Updated `start` script** to accept `APP_ENV` environment variable for environment selection
  - **Staging mode** sets `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` from `config.staging.domain` and labels process as "Staging Mode"

  ### Config-driven architecture

  `bos.config.json` is now the single source of truth. All hardcoded values have been eliminated in favor of deriving from config at runtime or build time:

  - **Removed hardcoded defaults** from `package.json` start script — `--account` and `--domain` no longer have shell fallbacks; config is read from `bos.config.json`
  - **`BETTER_AUTH_URL`** now defaults to `config.hostUrl` instead of hardcoded `localhost:3000`
  - **`fastkv.ts`** mainnet fallback uses the actual `accountId` parameter instead of hardcoded `"dev.everything.near"`
  - **Host page title** uses `config.domain` instead of hardcoded `"everything.dev"`
  - **UI app name** is injected at build time from `bos.config.json` via rsbuild `source.define` (was hardcoded `"everything.dev"` in 15+ route files)
  - **UI `about.tsx`** registry query params use `activeRuntime.accountId`/`gatewayId` instead of hardcoded values

  ### Breaking changes

  - `BOS_ACCOUNT` and `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` are no longer default-encoded in Docker image — config comes from `bos.config.json`
  - Docker `CMD` no longer passes `--account` / `--domain` — use `APP_ENV` env var to switch environments
  - `BosConfigSchema` now includes optional `staging` field — existing configs are unaffected
  - `StartOptionsSchema` now includes optional `env` field — existing invocations are unaffected
  - UI `branding.ts` `APP_NAME` now reads from `import.meta.env.APP_NAME` with `"everything.dev"` fallback

### Patch Changes

- 96a492e: Fix Docker build for nested workspaces

  Replace broken `COPY */package.json ./*/` with `COPY . .` before `bun install`, so nested workspace directories (`plugins/*/`, `packages/*/`) are present when Bun resolves workspaces. Fixes preview PR Docker builds failing with "Workspace not found".

- 7e1286a: ## Security hardening: SRI integrity, CORS tightening, and config cleanup

  ### Subresource Integrity (SRI) for remote entries

  - **New `everything-dev/integrity` module** with `computeSriHash`, `computeSriHashForUrl`, and `verifySriForUrl` — single source of truth for all integrity operations
  - **Deploy hooks** now compute SHA-384 hashes of `remoteEntry.js` and write `productionIntegrity`/`ssrIntegrity` to `bos.config.json` on deploy
  - **Client-side SRI**: `<script>` tags for remote entries now include `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes
  - **Server-side SRI verification** before loading SSR modules, API plugins, and UI federation remotes
  - **Integrity plumbing**: `productionIntegrity` and `ssrIntegrity` fields flow through `BosConfig` → `RuntimeConfig` → `ClientRuntimeConfig` → HTML rendering

  ### CORS hardening

  - **`host/src/services/auth.ts`**: Better Auth `trustedOrigins` now falls back to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]` instead of `[]` when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset, aligning with Hono CORS middleware
  - **`host/src/program.ts`**: Production warning when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset; fixed bug where empty `uiConfig.url` could be included as a CORS origin
  - **`packages/everything-dev/src/host.ts`**: CORS origins now include UI URL in fallback; production warning added
  - **Production warning** added for missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

  ### Config / type cleanup

  - **Removed `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl`** from `ClientRuntimeInfo` — these leaked arbitrary config data to the client
  - **Renamed `ActiveRuntimeInfo`** to `ClientRuntimeInfo` everywhere for consistency
  - **Deduplicated `SharedDepConfigSchema`** — now an alias for `SharedConfigSchema`
  - **Added `productionIntegrity`** to `BosConfigInput` interface, removing `as any` cast
  - **Added `testnet`** to `BosConfigSchema`

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed trailing slash inconsistency in host's SSR URL construction
  - Fixed SRI integrity check being inside Effect retry scope (now fails fast, only module loading is retried)
  - Added `integrity` verification to API plugin loading (`everything-dev/src/api.ts` and `host/src/services/plugins.ts`)

  ### Breaking changes

  - `ActiveRuntimeInfo` type removed — use `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl` removed from `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `BetterAuth` `trustedOrigins` default changed from `[]` to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]`

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 1cea1e1: Fix mixed content errors when behind reverse proxy (Railway, etc.)

  Added support for `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers to correctly determine the request URL when the server is behind a reverse proxy. This fixes mixed content errors where HTTPS pages were making HTTP API requests.

  Also added `secureHeaders` middleware for additional security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
