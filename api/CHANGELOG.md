## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 4772e1f: Simplify API to a thin orchestration layer: replaces the upvotes table with a `things` registry (`thingId`, `pluginId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`), adds Effect service layers (Registry, Votes), and introduces plugin dispatch via `getThingProvider()` so the API delegates to plugins by `pluginId`. Adds `createThing`, `getThing`, `deleteThing` (admin-only), `subscribeThings` endpoints with SSE filtering by `pluginId`/`type`/`action`. Adds `deleteThing` to `_template` plugin contract/service/handler. Extracts `ApiContextSchema`, `pluginContext`, `runEffect` into `lib/context.ts`. Renames service files `thing-registry`→`registry`, `thing-votes`→`votes` with matching symbol renames. Removes obsolete `lib/plugins.ts`. Adds frontend thing registry routes under `/things/` (index, create, detail with vote controls, admin delete, live SSE stream). Improves DB Layer with idempotent migrator. Updates api-and-auth and plugin-development skill docs.

### Patch Changes

- 3733ef7: Rename `api/src/lib/plugins.ts` to `api/src/lib/context.ts`. Extract `ContextSchema` as a shared Zod schema with derived `Context` type, replacing the inline schema in `createPlugin`. Add old path to `OBSOLETE_FILES` in upgrade.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d46dbee: Pass full organization and NEAR context from host to plugins

  The host's `buildPluginContext()` now forwards the complete `organization`
  and `near` objects from the auth plugin's `getContext()`, not just the
  flat `organizationId` and `walletAddress` strings.

  **Host:**

  - Store full `contextResult.organization` and `contextResult.near` in
    Hono context variables during session middleware
  - Pass both objects through `buildPluginContext()` to all plugins

  **API plugin:**

  - Add `organization` and `near` zod schemas to the context schema so
    routes and middleware can access org metadata (including `daoAccountId`
    from `organization.organization.metadata`) and NEAR capabilities

  **Template & Settings plugins:**

  - Expand context schema to reflect the full surface of available fields:
    `user`, `organization` (with `organization`, `member`, `isPersonal`,
    `hasOrganization`), `near` (with `primaryAccountId`, `linkedAccounts`,
    `hasNearAccount`), `walletAddress`, and `apiKey`
  - Added documentation comment listing all available context fields

  **CLI (everything-dev):**

  - Fix type error in `resolveRemoteConfigChain` where `BosConfig` was
    passed as `BosConfigInput` to `mergeBosConfigWithExtends`
  - Update plugin-development SKILL.md with a comprehensive Request Context
    Reference section documenting all fields, common patterns, and the
    minimal context pattern

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- b662086: Replace manual EventSource SSE with oRPC MemoryPublisher + eventIterator. Eliminates MaxListenersExceededWarning from Node EventTarget, stabilizes query keys to prevent refetch cascades, and adds typed streaming via VoteEventSchema contract.
