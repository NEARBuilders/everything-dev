# api

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c0452e7: Renamed `productionIntegrity` to `integrity` across all schemas, build configs, and `bos.config.json`. Added `name` and `version` fields to `BosPluginRef`. Enhanced `bos plugin add` with `bos://account/plugins/name` registry resolution, manifest validation, and automatic integrity computation. Enhanced `bos plugin publish` with manifest validation, integrity computation, and FastKV plugin registry writes. Added generic KV routes (`kvGet`, `kvList`, `kvPrepareWrite`, `kvRelayWrite`) to the registry plugin.
- c29e058: Migrate auth from plugin to app-level infrastructure. Host mounts only the raw Better Auth handler; authClient is injected separately from pluginsClient. Plugins receive auth context per-request, not via injected clients. Projects plugin cleaned of auth-proxying routes. Deleted every-plugin/context.ts.

### Patch Changes

- a483214: Fix build and test issues after switching to local better-near-auth

  - Added `@hot-labs/near-connect@0.11.2` as a root dependency and override to resolve missing prebuilt artifacts from the GitHub version
  - Fixed duplicate `"clsx"` key in `ui/package.json` that caused `bun install` warnings
  - Updated `better-near-auth` API usage in `$gatewayId.tsx` to match new `buildSignedDelegateAction(receiverId, builderFn)` signature and `relayTransaction({ payload })` shape
  - Fixed `deposit` → `attachedDeposit: 0n` to satisfy `AmountInput` type requirements
  - Removed unused `normalizePath` function in `plugins/auth/rspack.config.js`
  - Fixed `EmitPluginManifest` `srcPath` from `"types/auth-export.d.ts"` to `"auth-export.d.ts"` (plugin already prefixes `types/`)
  - Added `--root .` to `api` vitest scripts to prevent test discovery leaking into other workspace packages

- 368c872: Improve plugin lifecycle cleanup, add additionalExports, and share BosConfigInput

  Plugin shutdown now logs warnings instead of silently swallowing errors. DB layers use Effect acquireRelease for proper connection cleanup. Build system supports additionalExports for bundling extra type files. BosConfigInput is now exported from everything-dev/types for shared use. Registry plugin validates private key format before creating relay clients.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d96b5d3: Enforce effect and zod as singleton shared dependencies across Module Federation runtime

  - Add `effect` and `zod` as direct dependencies in api, host, and ui packages with catalog-pinned exact versions
  - Move `every-plugin` from devDependencies to dependencies in api and ui (runtime import)
  - Add `effect` and `zod` to `bos.config.json` `shared.ui` as singleton MF shared deps to prevent duplicate runtime instances
  - Pin `effect`, `zod`, and `@orpc/*` to exact versions in workspace catalog and add overrides to eliminate version drift
  - Unify `@orpc/*` version refs across api, host, and ui to use catalog instead of mixed ranges
  - Update `every-plugin` mf-config to resolve effect/zod versions from installed packages instead of hardcoded ranges
  - Merge `overrides` field in sync flow's `mergePackageJson` to preserve user overrides during upgrade

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- aeab5ce: Remove demo routes and fix plugin routing. API shell now only exposes `ping` and `authHealth` (with `requireAuth` middleware). Plugin-specific routes are registered before the base API catch-all in Hono, fixing 404s on `/api/rpc/{plugin}/*`. OpenAPI spec includes the current domain as an available server.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 4efd2db: ## Extract business logic into plugins

  ### Breaking changes (api)

  All business routes have been removed from the `api` package. The API is now a thin structural shell with only health and error routes:

  - **Removed**: `listRegistryApps`, `getRegistryApp`, `getRegistryAppsByAccount`, `getRegistryAppByHost`, `getRegistryStatus`, `prepareRegistryMetadataWrite`, `relayRegistryMetadataWrite` (moved to `plugins/registry/`)
  - **Removed**: `listKeys`, `getValue`, `setValue`, `deleteKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listProjects`, `getProject`, `createProject`, `updateProject`, `deleteProject`, `listProjectApps`, `linkAppToProject`, `unlinkAppFromProject`, `listProjectsForApp` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listApiKeys`, `createApiKey`, `deleteApiKey` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Removed**: `listOrgMembers`, `listOrgInvitations`, `cancelInvitation`, `resendInvitation` (moved to `plugins/projects/`)
  - **Kept**: `ping`, `authHealth`, `publicError`, `protectedError`
  - **Kept**: `requireAuth`, `requireNearAccount`, `requireOrgRole` middleware (duplicated in plugins)

  ### New: registry plugin (`@everything-dev/registry-plugin`)

  FastKV app discovery, metadata publish/relay. No database required.

  - All registry routes from the API are now under `apiClient.registry.*`
  - Configuration via `REGISTRY_RELAY_*` secrets and optional `registryNamespace` variable

  ### New: projects plugin (`@everything-dev/projects-plugin`)

  Projects CRUD, KV store, org management, API keys. SQLite via libsql.

  - All projects/KV/org/API key routes from the API are now under `apiClient.projects.*`
  - Configuration via `PROJECTS_DATABASE_URL` and `PROJECTS_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` secrets

  ### UI changes

  Stale route files for organizations, keys, apps, and settings pages were removed. Project pages (detail, list, new) were later restored to work with the namespaced projects plugin client.

  All `apiClient` calls to business routes must now use namespaced access:

  - `apiClient.listRegistryApps()` → `apiClient.registry.listRegistryApps()`
  - `apiClient.getProject()` → `apiClient.projects.getProject()`
  - `apiClient.listKeys()` → `apiClient.projects.listKeys()`
  - etc.

### Minor Changes

- d1a56cb: ## API pluginsClient: in-process plugin composition

  The API plugin receives a `pluginsClient` map of typed client factories via `createPlugin.withPlugins<PluginsClient>()`, enabling in-process calls to other plugin routers without HTTP roundtrips.

  - **New**: `createPlugin.withPlugins<P>()` on `every-plugin` — pre-binds the plugins type generic, eliminating the `plugins: null as unknown as P` hack
  - **New**: Generated types now live alongside their consumers — `api/src/plugins-client.gen.ts` and `ui/src/api-contract.gen.ts` instead of `.bos/generated/`
  - **New endpoint**: `GET /api/demo/plugins` — demonstrates variable flow from `bos.config.json` and in-process plugin client usage
  - **Config-driven**: API variables (`app.api.variables`) and plugin variables (`plugins.{key}.variables`) configured in `bos.config.json`
  - **Generic host**: No plugin-specific code in the host — it loads plugins from config and injects client factories

  ### Usage

  ```typescript
  import type { PluginsClient } from "./plugins-client.gen";

  export default createPlugin.withPlugins<PluginsClient>()({
    initialize: (config, plugins) =>
      Effect.sync(() => ({
        plugins,
        demoMessage: config.variables.demoMessage,
      })),
    createRouter: (services, builder) => ({
      pluginDemo: builder.pluginDemo.handler(async () => {
        const status = await services.plugins.registry().getRegistryStatus();
        return {
          apiVariable: services.demoMessage,
          registryStatus: status,
          availablePlugins: Object.keys(services.plugins),
        };
      }),
    }),
  });
  ```

### Patch Changes

- d4df05d: ## Infrastructure: CI optimization, Docker hardening, staging environments, config-driven architecture

  ### CI/CD improvements

  - **Consolidated lint + typecheck** into a single job (was 2 sequential), removing ~1-2 minutes per CI run
  - **Replaced `bun lint` + `bun format:check`** with single `biome ci .` command
  - **Pinned Bun version** to `"1.4"` in all workflows (was `latest`)
  - **Added native caching** via `setup-bun@v2` cache option (removed redundant `actions/cache`)
  - **Upgraded `actions/checkout`** from v6 to v4
  - **Parallelized typecheck** across packages using background processes (`& wait`)
  - **Staging deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/staging.yml`) — builds `:staging` image on merge to main
  - **Preview deployment workflow** (`.github/workflows/preview.yml`) — builds `:pr-N` image per PR, comments preview URL
  - **CI workflows read domain from `bos.config.json`** via `jq` instead of hardcoding

  ### Docker hardening

  - **Non-root user**: Container now runs as `appuser` (UID 1001) instead of root
  - **Layer caching**: Dependencies installed before source code copy for better cache hits
  - **Bun 1.4**: Updated base image from `oven/bun:1.3.9-alpine` to `oven/bun:1.4-alpine`
  - **Added `curl` and `/health` healthcheck** with 30s interval
  - **Removed `Dockerfile.dev`**: Development flow uses `bos dev`, not a dev Docker image
  - **Added `railway.json`** for Railway deployment configuration with health checks

  ### Staging environment support

  - **Added `staging` field** to `BosConfigSchema` for staging domain configuration
  - **Added `--env` flag** to CLI start command supporting `production` and `staging` environments
  - **Updated `start` script** to accept `APP_ENV` environment variable for environment selection
  - **Staging mode** sets `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` from `config.staging.domain` and labels process as "Staging Mode"

  ### Config-driven architecture

  `bos.config.json` is now the single source of truth. All hardcoded values have been eliminated in favor of deriving from config at runtime or build time:

  - **Removed hardcoded defaults** from `package.json` start script — `--account` and `--domain` no longer have shell fallbacks; config is read from `bos.config.json`
  - **`BETTER_AUTH_URL`** now defaults to `config.hostUrl` instead of hardcoded `localhost:3000`
  - **`fastkv.ts`** mainnet fallback uses the actual `accountId` parameter instead of hardcoded `"dev.everything.near"`
  - **Host page title** uses `config.domain` instead of hardcoded `"everything.dev"`
  - **UI app name** is injected at build time from `bos.config.json` via rsbuild `source.define` (was hardcoded `"everything.dev"` in 15+ route files)
  - **UI `about.tsx`** registry query params use `activeRuntime.accountId`/`gatewayId` instead of hardcoded values

  ### Breaking changes

  - `BOS_ACCOUNT` and `GATEWAY_DOMAIN` are no longer default-encoded in Docker image — config comes from `bos.config.json`
  - Docker `CMD` no longer passes `--account` / `--domain` — use `APP_ENV` env var to switch environments
  - `BosConfigSchema` now includes optional `staging` field — existing configs are unaffected
  - `StartOptionsSchema` now includes optional `env` field — existing invocations are unaffected
  - UI `branding.ts` `APP_NAME` now reads from `import.meta.env.APP_NAME` with `"everything.dev"` fallback

- 7e1286a: ## Security hardening: SRI integrity, CORS tightening, and config cleanup

  ### Subresource Integrity (SRI) for remote entries

  - **New `everything-dev/integrity` module** with `computeSriHash`, `computeSriHashForUrl`, and `verifySriForUrl` — single source of truth for all integrity operations
  - **Deploy hooks** now compute SHA-384 hashes of `remoteEntry.js` and write `productionIntegrity`/`ssrIntegrity` to `bos.config.json` on deploy
  - **Client-side SRI**: `<script>` tags for remote entries now include `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes
  - **Server-side SRI verification** before loading SSR modules, API plugins, and UI federation remotes
  - **Integrity plumbing**: `productionIntegrity` and `ssrIntegrity` fields flow through `BosConfig` → `RuntimeConfig` → `ClientRuntimeConfig` → HTML rendering

  ### CORS hardening

  - **`host/src/services/auth.ts`**: Better Auth `trustedOrigins` now falls back to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]` instead of `[]` when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset, aligning with Hono CORS middleware
  - **`host/src/program.ts`**: Production warning when `CORS_ORIGIN` is unset; fixed bug where empty `uiConfig.url` could be included as a CORS origin
  - **`packages/everything-dev/src/host.ts`**: CORS origins now include UI URL in fallback; production warning added
  - **Production warning** added for missing `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`

  ### Config / type cleanup

  - **Removed `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl`** from `ClientRuntimeInfo` — these leaked arbitrary config data to the client
  - **Renamed `ActiveRuntimeInfo`** to `ClientRuntimeInfo` everywhere for consistency
  - **Deduplicated `SharedDepConfigSchema`** — now an alias for `SharedConfigSchema`
  - **Added `productionIntegrity`** to `BosConfigInput` interface, removing `as any` cast
  - **Added `testnet`** to `BosConfigSchema`

  ### Bug fixes

  - Fixed trailing slash inconsistency in host's SSR URL construction
  - Fixed SRI integrity check being inside Effect retry scope (now fails fast, only module loading is retried)
  - Added `integrity` verification to API plugin loading (`everything-dev/src/api.ts` and `host/src/services/plugins.ts`)

  ### Breaking changes

  - `ActiveRuntimeInfo` type removed — use `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `resolvedConfig` and `canonicalConfigUrl` removed from `ClientRuntimeInfo`
  - `BetterAuth` `trustedOrigins` default changed from `[]` to `[hostUrl, ...uiUrl]`

  - Add "My Projects" section to home page
  - Add "In Projects" section to app detail page showing which projects contain the app

### Patch Changes

- 44393e7: Fix published app discovery and FastKV publish flow so registry reads use the stored manifest data, publish can succeed after FastKV indexing, and the app explorer links directly to the FastKV config record.
- 44393e7: Add plugin support with improved module federation service, shared dependencies handling, and auth client integration
